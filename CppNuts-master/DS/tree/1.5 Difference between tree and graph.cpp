// TOPIC: Difference between TREE & GRAPH

// TREE :
// 0. Only one path exist between two vertices (Nodes).
// 1. Root node is the starting node of the tree.
// 2. Tree doesn't have loops.
// 3. Number of edges: n-1 (where n is number of nodes)
// 4. Tree looks like Hierarchicalaa
// 5. All trees are graph.

// GRAPH :
// 0. More than one path is allowed between two vertices.
// 1. There is no root node concept (we can start from any node).
// 2. There can be loop in graph.
// 3. Number of edges are not defined.
// 4. Graph looks like Network.
// 5. All graphs are not tree.
