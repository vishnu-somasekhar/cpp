//It does not work. Try replacing “int *p;” with “int *p = NULL;” and it will try to dereference a null pointer.
// This is because fun() makes a copy of the pointer, so when malloc() is called, it is setting the copied pointer to 
// the memory location, not p. 
// p is pointing to random memory before and after the call to fun(), and when you dereference it, it will crash.
// If you want to add memory to a pointer from a function, you need to pass the address of the pointer (ie. double pointer).
// Thanks to John Doe for providing the correct solution.
void fun(int *a)

	a = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));

	int *p;

	*p = 6;
	printf("%d\n",*p);
