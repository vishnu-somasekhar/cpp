// When we use new keyword to dynamically allocate memory, two things happen: memory allocation and constructor call. 
// The memory allocation happens with the help of operator new. In the above program, there is a user defined operator new, 
// so first user defined operator new is called, then constructor is called.
// The process of destruction is opposite. First, destructor is called, then memory is deallocated
